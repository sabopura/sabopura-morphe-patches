/**
 * Opens live streams in Twitch's native player screen instead of the React Native one that
 * Twitch 31.x tests ("Ultralight"). The player button, danmaku, chat tools and the ad cover only
 * exist in the native screen. The home feed stays as it is; a tap on a stream is handed to the
 * native screen, as Twitch does when the experiment is off. (Technique from bakwudo/uyu.)
 *
 * Twitch 30.7.2 has no React Native player screen, so there is nothing to change there.
